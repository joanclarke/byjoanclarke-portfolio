            Iâ€™m extremely excited to invite you to explore my profile and learn
            a little more about me. I am a Front-End Developer with a passion
            for making clean, responsive and user-friendly websites and
            applications. My favorite part of being a developer is taking ideas
            from concept to completion. Being able to bring ideas to life is as
            intriguing as it is fulfilling.
